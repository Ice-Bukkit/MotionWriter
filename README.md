> Supports to make extention motions with some easy to use functions such as move, rotate (See [this](#how-image-generating-functions-such-as-move-rotate--works))<br>
> Includes default basic motions<br>

## How image-generating functions (such as move, rotate, ...) works
 * move (transfer)<br>
   * get moved image for (a,b)
   * Function expression<br>
     $x\prime=x+a$<br>
     $y\prime=y+b$
 * rotate (rotation)<br>
   * get rotated image by $\theta$ as of (a,b)
   * Function expression<br>
     $x\prime=(x-a)\cos\theta-(y-b)\sin\theta+a$<br>
     $y\prime=(x-a)\sin\theta+(y-b)\cos\theta+b$
